Gadabout: Find Great Events on the Fly

By Robert Birch

This app uses two APIS, a third will be integrated later to facilitate geocodes _queries_ from the user.  The three APIs that are used are from GoogleGeocodes, Meetup and OpenWeatherMap.

The primary objective of this app is to find events that relevant to the user that day. For example, soccer meetups in Austin or 
Python meetups in Boston and the app will spout out a short list of possible meetups.

The technologies used in this app are jquery, JavaScript, HTML and CSS.
